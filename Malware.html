		<p>The internet is an essential part of our lives.</br>However, it is also a place for <b>cybercriminals</b>: hackers or 'black hats', the bad witches of world.             These peolpe create and circulate very destructive programs to steal information, attack bussinesses or simply for fun.</br>Understanding the enemy is the                first step towards an effective defence.</br>Malicius software (<b>malware</b>) comes in many differents forms. What all these programs have in common is the             internet to infiltrate a computer system without the owner's consent. Viruses are the most famous example of malware. They perform various kinds of damage to             people's computers: they <b>erase files, crash the system and steal intellectual property</b>. To propagate from one computer to another, a virus needs a host            program: in the old days, a floppy disk or CD-ROM; today, an email attchment. Unlike viruses, worms don't need a host program and move between computers or               networks without help from anyone. They propagate quickly and create a real cyberinfection.
			Users sometimes install malware by mistake when they click on link and download software from a website. The application downloaded seems useful but actually             contains a destructive program.</br>A <b>Trojan horse</b> a hacker access to your computer, so that can cause damage or retrieve information. Often Trojan                horses come with a keylogger. This is a type of spyware: program that collects small pieces of information about the users without their knowledge. Keyloggers            track the keys the user touches on his keyboard: monitor what he writes, including passwords and PINs. Hackers then often use this information to steal the               user's identity or money.
